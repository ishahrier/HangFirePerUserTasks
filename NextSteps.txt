all tasks have some basic set of options (abaseoptions)
atasks hase some base tasks activities (abasetask)
all scheduled tasks is derived from a abasescheduled tasks
all fire and forget tasks are derived froma base fire and forget tasks abasefireandforgettask

job manager class is incomplete. this will create a job in the db first then get the id
then create the hangfire job passing an option to the task class that options will have the id of the user task
(not the hangfire job id ).

now question is how would you update the user tasks table when hangfire does different things in different staage
like how do you know when you task is enquered (note that you do not have the hangfire job id in the option class only the 
user tasks table id) ? answer is i will use the job filter.

NEXT step is to try

1. extract the option that is lassed to the tasks during the job filter and from that string options
, we create the option object and get the user tasks table id and then go to that table and update the tasks table
with the hangfire id and the status of the job.

now challenege is that i do not know how to inject dependency injection in the jobfilter class, becuase i need to inject application dbcontext
to talk to the database to update the table.so this is where i am at now.... ;-)
